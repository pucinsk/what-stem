# 🚲 What Stem?
https://pucinsk.github.io/what-stem/

**What Stem?** is a simple yet useful tool that helps cyclists compare different bicycle stem options in terms of **effective reach**, **stack**, and **angle**. It also provides a **visual overlay** to understand how stems differ in real-world dimensions.

**What Stem?** has been inspired by well known handlebars comparison tool [https://whatbars.com/](https://whatbars.com/)
